You can play a working version of the game on [itch.io](Link here) or [New Grounds](Link here).

This prototipe was made in the Godot game engine using GDscript.

This is a Godot 8-bit roguelike with darkness mechanics **prototype**, it is intended to be a simple reference for **beginners** making a similar game.
**We will not develop this game further**, but we will be fixing bugs and stuff, balancing the game, maybe adding some necessary features, etc. Feel free to fork and make changes, create issues and discussions, make your own pull request to improve the game, etc. 

**You can use the code and assets as you like.**


###  Installation
Just import the source/**Project.godot** using the Godot engine.


## Controls
**Arrows(↑,↓,→,←) to move** 
Your goal is to light the torch in the room at the end, but you'll need keys to open the doors that block your way. Watch out for the monsters and don't let your lamp run out!
